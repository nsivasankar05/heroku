            <h1>Fun things to do in Pokémon Sun during the Postgame</h1>

            <h2>Finished playing Pokémon Sun? Can't quite seem to get your hands on a copy of Pokémon Ultra Sun and Moon? Bored finding things to do in the Postgame? This page is a list about all the things you can do in the Pokémon Sun Postgame. Note that these will not be listed in any particular order. Lets begin.</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Fill up your Pokédex</li>

                <p>As you venture on through the Island Challenge, you may not have a lot of time to catch every single Pokémon in the region and evolve them if possible.
                    Filling your Pokédex is something you'll want to do without a doubt, even though I haven't filled up mine. You have the ability to go around the different
                    islands catching the different Pokémon, Legendaries and Ultra Beasts. Additionally, the Pokémon that have an unknown habitat are Pokémon who need to previously
                    be levelled up to evolve. If you're bored after completing the game, this is definitely something you should do.
                </p>

                </div>
                <li>Collect Zygarde Cells</li>

                <p>If you know what Zygarde is, this is one definitely for you. Basically, you can collect these cells around the Alola Region, which combine to create a kind of Pokémon
                    called Zygarde. These cells are found throughout the Alola Region and there are 95 of these Zygarde Cells. Additionally, there are three different types of Zygarde Forms.
                    The first one is a 10% form, a 50% form and a full form with the Power Construct ability. The 10% form resembles a dog, the 50% form combines to form a snake, and the full
                    forms the full form with the Power Construct ability. I personally, have the 50% form, even though I liked the 10% in all honesty. Either way, if you've collected a bunch
                    of Zygarde Cells and desire to keep going, then this activity is definitly for you.
                </p>

                </div>
                <li>Explore Festival Plaza</li>

                <p>This one is by far one of my favourites. Festival Plaza is a place where you can interact with other players, share common interests and tell them a bit about yourself. Additionally,
                    it's also a good place for your Pokémon to be in. There are many stalls such as the Johto Tent, Stomp-Stomp House and the Friendship Parlor. When interacting with other players, your
                    goal is tomake them feel welcome and satisfied. In order to do this, you must give them the best possible answer to their question in order to earn FC. FC, also known as Festival Coins,
                    are little rewards you earn from making a player satisfied. These Festival Coins can help level up your Festival Plaza to the next rank. When you level up, Sophocles, the owner comes to the
                    castle and congratulates you. You even get the option to replace one of your current stalls with a new one. Another good thing about Festival Plaza is that you can make actual friends whom
                    you can engage in link trades and battles with, but you also get the options to explore different types of trades and battles. This is definitely one I have a lot of fun with and I'd definitely
                    recommend you to try this out. 
                </p>

                </div>
                <li>Trade on the GTS</li>

                <p>I by far always do this regularly, and that is trading on the GTS. Here's how it works. You deposit any Pokémon into the GTS for any Pokémon that you want and you recieve your desired Pokémon
                    when someone accepts your offer. You can also seek Pokémon to check the different types of offers available. I've been doing this for a long time now and I've made so many good memories with this. One of my most recent acquisitions was a Rayquaza for an Amoonguss (Not
                    Among Us so don't get the wrong idea.). When checking available offers, I happened to notice a shiny Rayquaza for the exact same Pokémon! I was slightly upset I didn't get the shiny version, but I'm still happy because I at least got a Rayquaza, a Pokémon that I've been
                    wanting for a long time. Currently, I just acquired an Aipom. I'm definitely not sure about which Pokémon to acquire next, but I'll sure hope to try trade for a legendary. Anyhow, this activity is a must try for everyone who owns Pokémon Sun and or Moon.
                </p>

                <li>Explore Wonder Trade</li>

                <p>Even though I don't use this feature a lot, I still think it's quite cool. Wonder Trade is a form of trade where you can automatically trade any Pokémon of your choice, but you get a random Pokémon from your trade partner
                    in return. I'd suggest you be careful on Wonder Trade as some people tend to trade their worst Pokémon on there. I once traded a Litwick and ended up receiving a Caterpie in return. So be careful of what you trade on Wonder Trade.
                    I did have some alright acquisitions, but they weren't the greatest. To end of here, I recommend you at least give this a try, even if you're not satisfied with the outcome
                </p>

                <li>Go to Poké Pelago</li>

                <p>Poké Pelago is an island paradise place where you can collect Poké Beans and have your Pokémon participate in different activities. The island facilities are organized by Mohn, a now farmer who had previously lost his memory. Your boxed Pokémon
                    will be there just hanging around and the Poké Beans can attract wild Pokémon too! All you have to do for that is to check on it and come back the next day to check on it. There are three different types of beans, Plain Beans, Patterned Beans and 
                    Rainbow Beans. There is a giant beanstalk in the middle of the island which you can tap to collect Poké Beans. They then fall to the ground and you tap the fallen beans to collect them. Additionally, there are different isles in Poké Pelago which 
                    have activities such as farming, mining/cave exploration, fitness and relaxation. There are at least five isles I believe, I haven't used it a whole lot so I don't remember a lot of it. Either way, it's a great place for your Pokémon to play and 
                    level up and bond with other Pokémon.</p>

                <li>Catch Special QR Code Pokémon</li>

                <p>You should definitely know about this activity and you'll be so amazed doing this. Basically, how it works is that there are certain Pokémon that you can catch with QR Codes on certian days at certain islands. You open up the QR Code scanner in the menu and scan 
                    a Pokémon Sun and Moon QR Code, which you can search up online. You gain 10 points from scanning a QR Code but there's a specil set of 5 QR Codes where you get 20 points per scan. After that step, you then head to an island of your choice and then press a button 
                    to detect the Pokémon you have to catch. There will be a slight pause in the wild grass when you walk into it, but that's a good sign that you've run into the QR Code Pokémon. There is a list of Pokémon you can catch each day on certain islands, just one Pokémon per day!
                    If unsure, go check out Austin John's video about Pokémon Sun and Moon QR Code Pokémon and there, you'll find a list of available Pokémon corresponding to each island. I believe I've caught almost every Pokémon from the Pokémon QR Code set. I may be missing a few but for now, go catch yourself some QR Code Pokémon.

                    <li>Capture Ultra Beasts</li>

                    <p>Well, I suggested this because this was an interesting one to take a look into. This only happens in the post-game. What happens here is that there are Ultra Beast sightings around the Alola Region and your mission is to catch them with specially developed Poké Balls called Ultra Balls and they will be sent to the labs
                        for research and testing. There are approximately 4 Ultra Beasts, Nihilego, Buzzwole (Sun)/ Pheromosa (Moon), Xurkitree, Kartana (Sun)/ Celesteela (Moon) and Guzzlord. These missions are also supervised by Looker and his assistant, Annabelle. It starts off in a motel room where I believe you meet Annabelle there and talk and
                        then all of a sudden, Looker bursts in alerting you in various languages that there's been an Ultra Beast sighting. Immediately, you are instructed to go to the area of that sighting and catch it. After you've caught the Ultra Beast, you arrive back at the motel and report to Looker. This is just what I personally remember,
                        so I don't completely remember the whole thing detail by detail. I'm sure a lot of you have definitely done this and have moved onto Pokémon Ultra Sun and Moon, but I thought this would be a good one to put on the list.
                    </p>

                    <li>Battle the creator of Pokémon?!</li>

                    <p>This may seem ming boggling or not but you can battle the creator of the beloved Pokémon game. You fly to Akala Island and go straight on the road at the Pokémon Center and you go to a building, believed to be the GAME FREAK Building. You arrive at the top floor and open the door to enter the GAME FREAK Lab, where you see the developers
                        and the Creator of Pokémon. When you challenge him to a battle, you will see the message "You are being challenged by GAME FREAK Morimoto". However, you can only battle him once a day but the good part about it is that he  heals up you Pokémon for you at the end of each battle. Not to mention it's a great source of income alongside Pyukumuku Catching.
                        I was so excited when I heard about this activity and I realized I had to try it immediately. I was a little suprised that they used a veteran avatar for him as I thought he'd have more of a personalized avatar. Not to mention you get to look at copies of Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow and Green. Additionally, you get to interact and converse
                        with the developers at GAME FREAK, which I found quite nice. Even though some people have done this and whilst others think it's fake, I definitely suggest you try this out.

                    <li>Pyukumuku Catching</li>

                    <p>I might not have to explain a lot about this one as it's a fairly easy concept. This is not only a fun activity, but also a quick and easy way of generating income. The quick explanation on how to do this is to fly to the Pokémon Centre on Akala Island and go to the beach past Hano Grand Resort I believe. You then walk up to the guard and start a conversation
                        with him in order to start Pyukumuku Catching. They will be scattered all around the beach so be careful and don't forget to check twice in all areas of the beach. There are around six I believe that you might have to catch as I'm not looking at all that right now, but once you catch all of them, you go back to the guard you first talked to by that life guard 
                        chair and then collect your paycheck. Running short on cash for Poké Balls or potions? No problem, Pykumuku Catching is there for you! I've made some good money from doing this and I believe you should try it too.
                    </p>

                    <li>Explore Aether Paradise</li>

                    <p>I guess this will be the last one on the list of these cool things to do in the Postgame, you would've explored some of it already during the main game, but I just thought it would be interesting to talk about. Aether Paradise is basically a "VLFS"  (Very Large Floating Structure) which is the place where all of the research takes place.
                        You might have been there a bunch of times during the main game but you can also go there freely in the Postgame. It has 4 main floors, the Entrance, The Docks, the Conservation Area and the Lab Area. The Conserbation Area is like an Outdoor Garden Walkway Area where "stuff happens" basically. I think that's the simplest way to describe it.
                        This one's pretty obvious, but the Docks are where the boats and all that come and go. I don't have to explain the entrance, but the Lab Area is on the last floor, labelled as B2F I believe, and this is where all of the experiments and research are conducted. Once you exit the elevator to get to floor B2F, you want to head right and open a door,
                        which leads you to the labs. You would have been down there during the conversation about the Ultra Beasts, the more notable recollection of your time being there. While going through the main entrance and walking straight, you will happen to see a big house there. Yes, the one that "had" the portal. There are cages covering some doors and stairs which 
                        is unfortunate, but I don't know why. These days, you'll just see Faba chilling inside. I guess this wraps it up then.

                    </p>

            </ol>

            <h2>Well, this wraps up this website on Fun things to do in Pokémon Sun during the Postgame. I'm sure you would've done these things or if not, are looking to try them. There may be a couple of them that aren't really activities to do but I thought were interesting to talk about.
                So to end off on this note, go try them.
